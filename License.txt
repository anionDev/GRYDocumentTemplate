ConcreteLicenseTexts/GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.txt applies to: The sourcecode of the tex-template excluding the content of the thesis/elaboration/essay/paper/etc for which the template is used.
When you fork this repository to use it as template for your thesis/elaboration/essay/paper/etc with the result that you have a real document with content which does not belang to the template anymore so that the entire repository does not represent a template anymore then you are allowed to completely change the license to preserve full license-control over your document/content. It is obviously not allowed to change the license of the originally template itself.
